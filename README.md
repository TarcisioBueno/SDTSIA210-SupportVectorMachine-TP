# Support Vector Machine Project

This project contains an implementation of both Linear and Non-Linear Support Vector Machines (SVM) in a Jupyter notebook. It also includes the mathematical concepts behind these algorithms.

## Concepts Covered

- Linear SVM: This is a type of SVM that can be used when the data is linearly separable. It tries to find the best hyperplane that separates the data into different classes.

- Non-Linear SVM: This type of SVM is used when the data is not linearly separable. It uses a kernel function to transform the data into a higher dimension where it is linearly separable.
